# RUSH
**Reubens Universal System for Homework**

An open source self hosted homework system for schools.

This project is being made as part of my A level computer science qualification, so it will not be perfect. (Don't judge!)

## Client

Currently, there is no installer for the client (I plan to add one later). If you want to use the client, either clone the repo and run main.py in the client folder. remember this is a work in progress project, and it probably won't work. Also I can't be bothered to document this half baked system, so until I have an actual UX flow, you can figure it out yourself.

## Server

I haven't made the server yet.
